# password-generator
This is my option for Password Generator. 

## 
The fisrt I tried to defin what buttons I will need to proceed. Then I added all global var(s) to set settings for the password. Put all creterias into one var userChois to set one function generatePassword (I'm sure there is shorter way to assign all criterias). Added options to "push" it to tempArray using concat to put each of the choosen settings to my tempArray. And finally set var res (for final password) which is actual "empty passwordUser + all of choosen options from tempArray). 
* Note: when i tried to use passwordUser instead of tempArray - my password was 4 times longer then user said.
Added function to confirm each setting with true statment and alert if they are not true. Return each function in the end.
